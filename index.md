## ESIIL Stars Student

#### Hau! my name is Tanner Veo. I am an enrolled member of Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, but grew up on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Crow Creek Indian Reservation, and St. Joseph's Indian School. All of them are located in South Dakota. I am half Lakota and half Dakota (Oceti Šakowiŋ). My lived experiences have taught me the importance of human life and helping others, with a good heart and good intentions. I have an Asscioate in Environmental Science and Research and am I working towards my Bachelors of Science at United Tribes Technical College.

## I am excited to learn coding, website building, to incorporate into my skillset for grad school.
